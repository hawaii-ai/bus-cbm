## Learning a Clinically-Relevant Concept Bottleneck for Lesion Detection in Breast Ultrasound 
###### Github repository containing all relevant code for MICCAI 2024 submission 
This repository is designed to provide implementations of the training and validation scripts for our breast ultrasound (BUS) concept bottleneck model (CBM) from the ACR Breast Imaging and Reporting Data System (BI-RADS) masses lexicon for ultrasound, for lesion detection, description, and cancer classification. 5 sample labelled images are provided for testing and installation verification.
